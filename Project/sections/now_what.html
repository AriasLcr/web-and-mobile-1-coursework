                <p>
                    It is our responsibility to stay at home and enjoy the opportunities we have to keep moving on with our lives even without being able to meet other people in person.
                    This means finding new ways to do things.
                    Maybe it's trying a new hobby, learning something new online, or just spending more time with our family at home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember it's okay to feel sad or miss our normal lives. 
                    But, it's also a chance to find joy in little things, be creative, and discover new ways to have fun. 
                    Before we know it, things will get better, and we'll be out and about once more.
                    Until then, let's make the most of what we have.
                </p>
