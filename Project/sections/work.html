                <h2>Impact on Work</h2>

                <p>
                    Workers needed to make a living, so they were forced to reshape the way they did their job.
                    Many started working from home, turning their living spaces into makeshift offices.
                    This switch brought new challenges, like balancing work with household duties or managing distractions.
                    Businesses had to rely heavily on digital tools, from video meetings to online collaboration platforms.
                    Some jobs couldn't be done from home, leading to a rise in safety measures at workplaces or, unfortunately, job losses for others.
                    While some appreciated the flexibility and saved time from commuting, others missed the social aspect of office life.
                    The pandemic redefined the essence of work, prompting both challenges and innovations in the professional world.
