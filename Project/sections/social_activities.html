                <h2>Impact on Social Activities</h2>

                <p>
                    Since we had to stay home, how we hung out with others changed a lot. 
                    Big events, parties, or just meeting friends became rare or moved online.
                    Places like movie theaters, restaurants, and big game fields had to close or limit people.
                    Many started using the internet to chat, have online parties, or meet for work. 
                    But not seeing friends and family in person made some people feel lonely.
                    Everyone missed the simple joys of being together, laughing, and having fun like before.

                <p>Interviews conducted with students revealed that online conversations were often perceived as
                    less valuable than face-to-face interactions. Students cited challenges such as video call fatigue,
                    technology frustrations, and difficulty conveying emotions and subtleties online.
