                <h2>Impact on Education</h2>

                <p>
                    Education has been affected as students have to do all of their tasks online. 
                    And even though the students can benefit from using online resources,
                    it appears that their performance has not been as good as it was when they returned to in-person classes.
                </p>


                
                <p>Given that, what major changes has online education brought upon students?</p>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Digital Breach:</strong> <br>
                                Sometimes the access of resources doesn't allow some students to access online resources.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Loss of interactivity:</strong> <br>
                                Students struggle a lot more to pay attention since educators 
                                have no control over what the student is doing on the other side of the screen.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Loss of Learning:</strong> <br>
                                Getting better grades in online school is easier than in regular in-person school.
                                This is because students have access to online resources from that they can use to complete their assignments easily,
                                Defeating the entire purpose of tests and homework.
                            </p>
